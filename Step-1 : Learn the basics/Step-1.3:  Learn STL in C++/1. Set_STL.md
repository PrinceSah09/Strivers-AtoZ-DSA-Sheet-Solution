# Set

The Set is a container in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) that stores unique elements in a specific order. It is implemented as a sorted binary tree, which allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and searching operations.

## Key Features

- **Unique Elements**: The Set only stores unique elements. Duplicate elements are automatically rejected, ensuring that each element appears only once in the container.

- **Sorted Order**: The elements in a Set are sorted in a specific order defined by the comparison function. By default, the sorting is done in ascending order.

- **Efficient Operations**: The Set provides efficient operations for insertion, deletion, and searching, thanks to its underlying data structure.

## Usage Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>  // header file
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Create a Set of integers
    set<int> mySet;

    // Insert elements into the Set
    mySet.insert(5);
    mySet.insert(2);
    mySet.insert(8);
    mySet.insert(1);

    // Print the elements in sorted order
    for (auto element : mySet) {
        cout << element << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // Search for an element in the Set
    int key = 2;
    auto it = mySet.find(key);
    if (it != mySet.end()) {
        cout << "Element " << key << " found in the Set." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Element " << key << " not found in the Set." << endl;
    }

    // Remove an element from the Set
    mySet.erase(5);

    // Print the updated elements
    cout<<"After erasing 5 from set: ";
    for (const auto& element : mySet) {
        cout << element << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // Finding element present at which postition
    it = mySet.find(8);
    if(it!=mySet.end()){
        cout<<"8 Present at: "<<distance(mySet.begin(),it);
    }
    else cout<<"Not Present in set"<<endl;
    return 0;
}

```
```
## Output
1 2 5 8
Element 2 found in the Set.
1 2 8
8 Present at: 2
```



# Time Complexity of Set Operations

The time complexity of operations in a Set container in C++ STL can be summarized as follows:

- **Insertion**: O(log N) average case, O(N) worst case
- **Deletion**: O(log N)
- **Search**: O(log N)
- **Iterating**: O(N)

Here, N represents the number of elements in the Set.
