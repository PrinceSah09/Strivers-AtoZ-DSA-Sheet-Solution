# Deque (Double-Ended Queue) Data Structure in C++

A deque, short for double-ended queue, is a linear data structure that allows insertion and deletion at both ends. It combines the features of both stacks and queues, providing a versatile data structure.

In C++, you can implement a deque using the `deque` container from the C++ Standard Library, which provides a convenient interface and encapsulates the necessary functionality.

## Operations of a Deque

The common operations performed on a deque are:

1. **Push Front** (Insertion at Front): Adds an element to the front of the deque.
2. **Push Back** (Insertion at Back): Adds an element to the back of the deque.
3. **Pop Front** (Deletion from Front): Removes the element from the front of the deque.
4. **Pop Back** (Deletion from Back): Removes the element from the back of the deque.
5. **Front**: Retrieves the element at the front of the deque without removing it.
6. **Back**: Retrieves the element at the back of the deque without removing it.
7. **Empty**: Checks if the deque is empty.
8. **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the deque.

## Example Usage

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of a deque in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Create an empty deque of integers
    deque<int> myDeque;

    // Push elements at both ends
    myDeque.push_front(10);
    myDeque.push_back(20);
    myDeque.push_back(30);

    // Print the front and back elements
    cout << "Front element: " << myDeque.front() << endl;
    cout << "Back element: " << myDeque.back() << endl;

    // Pop elements from both ends
    myDeque.pop_front();
    myDeque.pop_back();

    // Print the size of the deque
    cout << "Size: " << myDeque.size() << endl;

    // Check if the deque is empty
    if (myDeque.empty()) {
    cout << "Deque is empty" << endl;
    }
}
```
```
Front element: 10
Back element: 20
Size: 1
```
