# Map in C++ STL

The Map is an associative container in C++ STL that stores a collection of key-value pairs. It provides a fast lookup for elements based on their keys. The Map is implemented as a balanced binary search tree, which ensures efficient operations on the container.

## Key Features

- Stores key-value pairs: Each element in a Map consists of a key and an associated value.
- Fast lookup: The average time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations is O(log N), where N is the number of elements.
- Sorted storage: The elements are stored in ascending order based on the keys.
- Balancing: The Map maintains a balanced binary search tree to ensure efficient operations.

## Usage Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    map<int, string> myMap;

    // Inserting elements
    myMap.insert({1, "John"});
    myMap.insert({2, "Emily"});
    myMap.insert({3, "Michael"});
    myMap.insert({4, "Sophia"});

    // Accessing elements by key
    cout << "Value associated with key 2: " << myMap[2] << endl;

    // Iterating over the map
    for (const auto& pair : myMap) {
        cout << "Key: " << pair.first << ", Value: " << pair.second << endl;
    }

    // Searching for a key
    auto it = myMap.find(3);
    if (it != myMap.end()) {
        cout << "Value associated with key 3: " << it->second << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Key 3 not found in the map." << endl;
    }

    // Removing an element
    myMap.erase(4);

    // Size of the map
    cout << "Size of the map: " << myMap.size() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
```
Value associated with key 2: Emily
Key: 1, Value: John
Key: 2, Value: Emily
Key: 3, Value: Michael
Key: 4, Value: Sophia
Value associated with key 3: Michael
Size of the map: 3
```

# unordered_map

unordered_map in STL are associative containers where each element consists of a key value and a mapped value. Two mapped values cannot have the same key value. The elements can be in any order.

```
unordered_map<int,int> mpp;
```

All the operation on unorederd map is same as normal Map

# unordered_multimap 

unordered_multimap in STL are associative containers like unordered maps where each element consists of a key value and a mapped value, the only difference is unordered multimaps can store duplicate elements
```
unordered_multimap<int,int> mpp;
```
