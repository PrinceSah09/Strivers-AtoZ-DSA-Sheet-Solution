# Stack Data Structure in C++

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It can be visualized as a stack of books, where the last book placed on the stack is the first one to be removed.

In C++, you can implement a stack using the `stack` container from the C++ Standard Library, which provides a convenient interface and encapsulates the necessary functionality.

## Operations of a Stack

The common operations performed on a stack are:

1. **Push** (Insertion): Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop** (Deletion): Removes the element from the top of the stack.
3. **Top**: Retrieves the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
4. **Empty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
5. **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## Example Usage

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of a stack in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Create an empty stack of integers
    stack<int> myStack;

    // Push elements
    myStack.push(10);
    myStack.push(20);
    myStack.push(30);

    // Print the top element
    cout << "Top element: " << myStack.top() << endl;

    // Pop an element
    myStack.pop();

    // Print the size of the stack
    cout << "Size: " << myStack.size() << endl;

    // Check if the stack is empty
    if (myStack.empty()) {
        cout << "Stack is empty" << endl;
    }
}

```
```
Top element: 20
Size: 2
```
