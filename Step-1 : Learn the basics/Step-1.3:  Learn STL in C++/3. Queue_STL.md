  # Queue Data Structure in C++

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It can be visualized as a real-world queue or line of people, where the first person to join the queue is the first one to leave.

In C++, you can implement a queue using the `queue` container from the C++ Standard Library, which provides a convenient interface and encapsulates the necessary functionality.

## Operations of a Queue

The common operations performed on a queue are:

1. **Enqueue** (Insertion): Adds an element to the end of the queue.
2. **Dequeue** (Deletion): Removes the element from the front of the queue.
3. **Front**: Retrieves the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
4. **Empty**: Checks if the queue is empty.
5. **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the queue.
6. **emplace**: to insert an element in the queue.

## Example Usage

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of a queue in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Create an empty queue of integers
    queue<int> myQueue;

    // Enqueue elements
    myQueue.push(10);
    myQueue.push(20);
    myQueue.push(30);

    // Print the front element
    cout << "Front element: " << myQueue.front() << endl;

    // Dequeue an element
    myQueue.pop();

    // Print the size of the queue
    cout << "Size: " << myQueue.size() << endl;

    // Check if the queue is empty
    if (myQueue.empty()) {
        cout << "Queue is empty" << endl;
    }
}

```
```
Front element: 10
Size: 2
```
