# List Container in C++ STL

The `list` container in C++ Standard Template Library (STL) represents a doubly linked list. It provides an efficient way to store and manipulate a sequence of elements.

## Features of std::list

- **Doubly Linked List**: The elements in a `std::list` are connected using pointers, allowing efficient insertion and deletion operations at both the beginning and end of the list.
- **Dynamic Size**: The size of a `std::list` can change dynamically as elements are added or removed.
- **Iterators**: `std::list` supports bidirectional iterators, allowing easy traversal and manipulation of the list.
- **Efficient Insertion and Removal**: Insertion and removal of elements in a `std::list` have a constant time complexity of O(1), regardless of the list size.
- **No Random Access**: Unlike arrays or vectors, `std::list` does not provide random access to elements. Accessing an element by index requires traversing the list from the beginning or end, which takes linear time.

## Example Usage

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `std::list` in C++:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
void printlist(list<int> li)
{
    list<int>::iterator it;
    for(it=li.begin();it!=li.end();it++)
    {
        cout<<*it<<" ";
    }
    cout<<endl;
}
int main()
{
    list<int> li;
    li.push_back(10);
    li.push_back(20);
    li.push_front(30);
    li.push_front(40);
    li.push_front(50);
    
    cout<<"The elements in the list are: ";
    printlist(li);
    cout<<"Reversing the list: ";
    li.reverse();
    printlist(li);
    cout<<"Sorting the list: ";
    li.sort();
    printlist(li);
    cout<<"The size of the list is: "<<li.size()<<endl;
    cout<<"The first element in the list: "<<li.front()<<endl;
    cout<<"Deleting the first element"<<endl;
    li.pop_front();
    printlist(li);
    cout<<"The last element of the list: "<<li.back()<<endl;
    cout<<"Deleting the last element"<<endl;
    li.pop_back();
    printlist(li);
    
}
```
```
The elements in the list are: 50 40 30 10 20
Reversing the list: 20 10 30 40 50
Sorting the list: 10 20 30 40 50
The size of the list is: 5
The first element in the list: 10
Deleting the first element
20 30 40 50
The last element of the list: 50
Deleting the last element
20 30 40
```

**1. Why we can't use sort(li.begin(),li.end()) in List DS for Sorting the entire list ?**

**Answer**: The list container in C++ is implemented as a doubly-linked list, where each element is connected to its neighboring elements through pointers. Unlike vectors or arrays, which provide random access to elements, accessing elements in a linked list requires traversing the list sequentially from the beginning or end.
